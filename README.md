This VolumeCalculator class shows many basic concepts in the java programming language. This program calculates the volume of a cube, cylinder, cone, and pyramid. 
The program takes in user input using the Scanner class. This allows for the program to take in keyboard input. A Scanner object is created to allow the programmer to take in keyboard input of many different data types. The only datatype that is taken is integer type data. The data is assigned to a variable with an integer data type. This allows the integer data to be manipulated with mathematics or with the Math class functions. 
The program also makes use of printing information onto the console screen. It uses the System class to print text on the console screen. This tells users when to input information so the program can use it. Without this prompt the program is not very accessible for the users.
The program makes use of mathematics in the code. The volumes of many shapes are calculated using mathematical symbols. The program also uses the Math class methods to do operations like power functions. This is necessary in java because there isn’t a symbol in the java language that does this. When calculating the volumes, the calculation is stored in variables of type double or integer depending on the volume formula for that shape.
All of the java concepts discussed above are very important for most java programs and are the building blocks of any programmer’s knowledge of java.
